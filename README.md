# How to

```bash
# UNIX
cd /path/to/monolog
chmod +x ./run.sh
./run.sh [--debug]  # Optional: Attach debuggers to Django and Celery

# Windows
# Git gives you unix commands, and bash support. 
# If it's already on your PATH, you should theoretically be able to run the script directly.
bash ./run.sh
```
